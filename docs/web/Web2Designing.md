 ### Team Collaboration 
 
Team collaboration is very very important for this course because course work is huge and you will be tired.If the team can collaborate with each other this course will be fun and easy and you can enjoy your holiday.

<h2>How to collaborate -</h2>
<br>
As the students are from different backgrounds, so collaborating with a diverse team of individuals from different backgrounds on GitHub can be a rewarding experience. It allows for the pooling of various skills and perspectives to create better software and foster a more inclusive and productive environment. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to collaborate using GitHub when team members come from different backgrounds:
<br>
<br>

1. Create a GitHub Repository:

One team member should create a GitHub repository that will serve as the central location for your project.

2. Invite Team Members:

In the repository, go to the "Settings" tab and navigate to "Collaborators & Teams."
Invite team members to collaborate by adding their GitHub usernames or email addresses. Ensure they have GitHub accounts.
(In this course teacher's open the repository and invite each team's admin and admin invite other team member's)

To invite member go to repository setting and click collaborator and team then add people

3. Establish Clear Communication:

Use various communication tools to ensure efficient and clear communication.Like wechat group, QQ group and so on.

4. Define Project Roles and Responsibilities:

By the roles and responsibilities of each team member the role can set by clicking Role.

5. Choose a Version Control Workflow:

Decide on a version control workflow that fits your project's needs. Common ones include Git Flow and GitHub Flow.

6. Set Up Local Development Environments:

Ensure that each team member sets up their local development environment. Provide clear instructions or a setup script to help everyone get started.

7. Create and Assign Issues:

Break down the project into smaller tasks and create issues for them. Assign issues to team members based on their expertise or interests.

8. Branch and Commit:

Team members should create branches for their assigned issues. Each branch should have a clear and concise name.

9. Commit code changes frequently with descriptive commit messages.

10. Pull Requests (PRs):

When a task is completed, team members create a pull request to merge their changes into the main branch.
Use the PR discussion to review code, discuss changes, and resolve issues. Encourage feedback and ensure a respectful tone in discussions.


11. Code Reviews:

Encourage thorough code reviews. Team members can learn from each other's code and offer suggestions for improvement.

12. Merge and Deploy:

After a PR is reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch. Use your deployment process to push changes to the production environment.
Documentation:

13. Create and maintain clear and comprehensive documentation for your project. This is especially important when team members have different backgrounds, as it aids in understanding.

14. Diversity and Inclusion Awareness:

Be mindful of diversity and inclusion within your team. Ensure that everyone feels respected and valued for their contributions.

15. Regular Check-Ins:

Hold regular team meetings or stand-ups to keep everyone aligned and informed about project progress.

16. Feedback and Improvement:

Continuously gather feedback from team members and users to improve both the project and the collaborative process.

17. Resolve Conflicts Gracefully:

Conflicts may arise, but it's essential to address them calmly and respectfully, promoting understanding and resolution.

By following these steps, you can collaborate effectively on GitHub with a diverse team, leveraging each member's unique background and skills to create a successful project.

<h3>Steps of building -</h3>

STEP-1 : Installing all the necessary tools.<br>
STEP-2 : Open repository into <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.</a><br>
STEP-3 : Publish the page from <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.</a><br>
STEP-4 : Clone the repository into <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop.</a><br>
STEP-5 : Open the repository into <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and write the code.<br>
STEP-6 : Install Docsify from terminal.<br>
STEP-7 : Code writing.<br>
STEP-8 : Push all the changes into origin.<br>

### STEP-1 : Installing all the necessary tools<br>
  - <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> as a host of the webpage.
  - <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> to push the code from local to origin.
  - <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to write code and document.
  - <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Nodejs</a> to build the environment.
  - <a href="https://www.nexmaker.com/doc/1projectmanage/markdown.html">Markdown</a> language to write the document.

### STEP-2 : Open repository into <a href="https://github.com/"> GitHub</a>
>First need to open an account on <a href="https://github.com/"> GitHub</a>.To create repository click New from home page.After that set the name,keep it public and add a readme file and then click create repository(follow the picture's where is surrounded by yellow circle for your better understand)
