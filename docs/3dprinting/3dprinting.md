### 3D Printing Background
<h2 align="center">Background and Basic</h2>
3D printing also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital model. It works by adding material layer by layer until the final object is formed.

<h2>Basic Process: </h2>Designing a Model: A digital 3D model is created using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software or obtained from 3D scanners that capture physical objects.

- Slicing: The digital model is sliced into thin horizontal layers using slicing software, generating a set of instructions (G-code) for the printer to follow.

- Printing: The 3D printer reads the G-code and starts building the object layer by layer using the selected material.

- Layer-by-Layer Construction: The material is deposited, solidified, or fused according to the design, gradually forming the final object.

<h2>Types of 3D Printing Technologies: </h2>

- Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)/Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF): This is one of the most common methods where thermoplastic filaments are heated and extruded through a nozzle to create layers.

- Stereolithography (SLA): Uses a UV laser to solidify liquid resin layer by layer to create precise and detailed objects.

- Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Utilizes a high-powered laser to fuse powdered materials (plastic, metal, etc.) together to form the object.

- Digital Light Processing (DLP): Similar to SLA, but uses a projector to cure entire layers of resin at once.

- Binder Jetting: Binder Jetting involves depositing a binding agent onto a bed of powder material selectively. Once a layer is complete, a new layer of powder is spread, and the process repeats until the object is formed.

- Material Jetting: Material Jetting operates similarly to inkjet printing, where droplets of material are selectively deposited onto a build platform and cured or solidified to form the object.



<h2>Materials for 3D printing:</h2>

- Plastics: PLA, ABS, PETG are commonly used in FDM printers.
- Resins: Used in SLA and DLP printers, offering high detail and smooth finishes.
- Metals: Aluminum, titanium, steel, etc., used in metal 3D printing processes.
- Ceramics, Composites, and more: The range of printable materials is continuously expanding.
<h2>Applications:<h2>

- Prototyping: Rapid creation of prototypes for product development.
- Customization: Personalized products like jewelry, prosthetics, and orthodontics.
- Manufacturing: Small-scale production of specialized parts and components.
- Healthcare: Creating implants, medical models, and bioprinting tissues.
<h2>Advantages:</h2>

- Design Freedom: Complex geometries and intricate structures are feasible.
- Rapid Prototyping: Accelerates the design and testing phase.
- Customization: Tailored products for specific needs.
- Reduced Waste: Material is used precisely, minimizing waste.
<h2>Limitations:</h2>

- Speed: Some processes can be time-consuming.
- Material Limitations: Certain materials may have limited availability or properties.
- Quality and Resolution: Surface finish and resolution might not match traditional manufacturing methods for some applications.

### G-Code

<img src="img/3D/3dprint/g-code-xl.png">

<h2>What is G-code. <a href="https://www.3dnatives.com/en/g-code-use-3d-printing-230920216/#!">Rerenfence</a></h2>
<br>

<img src="img/3D/3dprint/g-code-explain.png">

First we must understand the difference between a G-Code and an M-Code. Both are commands included in the file and tell the printer how and where to extrude the material. The only difference is that G-Codes are universally understood by printers using G-Codes, and M-Codes are those codes that are specific to individual printer lines. So, as we can see in the picture below, the language is made up of several parameters. The basic things to know when reading such a code are the different alphanumeric values.

The letters X / Y / Z refer to the three axes of the 3D printer that mark the coordinates. Any value of X above 0 moves the printhead to the right, any value of Y above 0 moves the printhead backwards, and any value of Z above 0 moves the printhead upwards. On the other hand, the letter F is understood as the speed at which the nozzle moves (indicated in mm/minute), while the letter E refers to the length of the movement (indicated in millimeters). Sometimes we can find text followed by the symbol “;” which serves to provide command information; these comments are not part of the code. Having understood how G-Codes can be read, let’s see which are the most common for the manufacture of a part.

The <b>G1</b> command is the most basic of all, in fact, it will make up 95% of the total file. It is a code that instructs the 3D printer to perform a linear motion while depositing material to the specified location at the coordinates that are given to it. So, when we read the code “G1 X10 Y20 F1200” we will be instructing the printer to move to the X=10mm Y=20mm position in the tray at a slower speed of 1200 mm/min. Unlike this command, the G0 has the same principle of movement, but without extruding material through the nozzle.

<b>G28.</b> This command is used for the machine to execute the start sequence, which will move the printhead to the far edges of the machine until it makes contact with the stops. If no axis is specified, the machine will automatically move all three, but you can always add X, Y, Z to the command. This is a useful way to quickly move an axis out of the way, especially when finishing the print.

<b>G92.</b> Instructs the printer to set the current position of its axes. This can be useful if you want to change or offset the location of one of the axes. This is usually done at the beginning of each layer or just before a main or retract command.

<b>M104.</b> This code is used to heat an extruder, and you must indicate which one (in case you have a double extrusion 3D printer), as well as the desired temperature. Thus, the command “M104 S200 T0” will order the machine to heat the extruder T0 (in the case of double extrusion, we would have T0 and T1) to a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius, indicated with the letter “S”. The other version of this G-Code, namely M109, will instruct the printer to wait for the extruder to reach the temperature before continuing with any other command.

M140 and M190. They are very similar to those already mentioned, except that in this case it does not refer to the extruder, but to the printing bed. In this case the letter “T” indicating the extruder to be heated is omitted.
