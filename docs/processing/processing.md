<h2 align="Center">Interface application programing</h2>

### Basic 
Processing is a free graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context.

Processing uses the Java language, with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage.

The Processing language and IDE have been the precursor to other projects including Arduino and Wiring.

- User interface

<img src="img/processing/userui_processing.png">

The Processing IDE (Integrated Development Environment) provides a platform for writing, compiling, and running code, particularly focusing on creative coding and visual arts. The UI in Processing on a MacBook Air or any macOS device generally follows standard design principles for Mac applications.

Here's an overview of what the Processing UI typically looks like on a MacOS (we work on MacOS,For other operating system the working and output are same) :

- Menu Bar: At the top of the screen, you'll find the standard macOS menu bar. It contains options like File, Edit, Sketch, Tools, and Help. These menus offer various functionalities such as creating new sketches, saving, running the code, and accessing preferences.

- Toolbar: The Processing IDE includes a toolbar with icons representing common actions like running the code, stopping execution, saving, and opening sketches.

- Code Editor: The main area of the interface is dedicated to writing and editing code. It features syntax highlighting, line numbers, and other typical code editor functionalities.

- Console/Output Area: Usually placed at the bottom of the window, this area displays feedback, errors, and output generated by the code when it's executed.

- Sketch Area/Canvas: This is where visual output or graphics created by the code are displayed. It could include animations, visual effects, or interactive elements depending on the code written.

- Tabs and Panels: Processing allows for multiple tabs for different sketches or files open simultaneously. Additionally, panels might contain features like libraries, errors, or sketches overview.

Preferences and Settings: Accessible through the menu bar, this section allows users to customize various aspects of the IDE, such as editor settings, font preferences, and more.

Since the Processing IDE follows macOS design conventions, it integrates well with the overall look and feel of the operating system, ensuring familiarity for users accustomed to macOS applications.

Keep in mind that the specifics might slightly vary based on the version of Processing or any customizations you might have made.

If you're using a MacOS and Processing, exploring the interface and experimenting with code within the IDE should be straightforward and consistent with the general macOS UI experience.

<h2>Features</h2> 
Processing includes a sketchbook, a minimal alternative to an integrated development environment (IDE) for organizing projects.

Every Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the PApplet Java class (formerly a subclass of Java's built-in Applet) which implements most of the Processing language's features.[8]

When programming in Processing, all additional classes defined will be treated as inner classes when the code is translated into pure Java before compiling.[9] This means that the use of static variables and methods in classes is prohibited unless Processing is explicitly told to code in pure Java mode.

Processing also allows for users to create their own classes within the PApplet sketch. This allows for complex data types that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as: int (integer), char (character), float (real number), and color (RGB, RGBA, hex).

<h2>Example</h2>
The following code is a better example of the look and feel of the language.

~~~
// Hello mouse.
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  stroke(255);
  background(192, 64, 0);
}

void draw() {
  line(150, 25, mouseX, mouseY);
}
~~~
