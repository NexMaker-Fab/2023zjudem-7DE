### Final project's Draft 

Â <h1 align="center">A SMART WASTE SEGREGATOR DUSTBIN</h1>

### PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT

To design a smart waste separator bin that would help contribute to alleviating the waste in many African areas and ensuring a proper channel of waste disposal and reuse/ recycling of waste without causing further harm to the environment. Many waste items such as plastic and metal can be reused or repurposed if they are separated from the rest of the garbage. However, manual sorting of waste is tedious, time-consuming, and inefficient. That is why we have developed an Arduino-based trash separation project that can automatically sort plastic and metal waste using sensors and actuators. Moreover, our project can also detect when the trash bin is full and alert the user or the waste management service. 


<h2>Project goal</h2>

- The waste separator bin;
- Act as a groundbreaking waste management solution
- Simplifies garbage sorting with advanced sensors and algorithms
- Reduces the need for multiple bins by incorporating separate chambers for different waste materials
- Saves time and effort by automatically sorting items like plastic bags, metal items
- Enhances aesthetics with a modern and stylish design
- Features a hand motion sensor for automatic lid opening upon approach
- Alerts users when chambers are full and need emptying

According to the UN, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 focuses on creating sustainable cities and communities. The goal emphasizes the importance of making urban areas inclusive, safe, resilient, and environmentally sustainable. Here are key components and targets of SDG 11:

1. Urbanization Challenges:
SDG 11 addresses the challenges posed by rapid urbanization. As more people move to cities, the goal is to ensure that this growth is managed in a way that is sustainable and does not lead to negative impacts on the environment, infrastructure, and social well-being.

2. Inclusive and Safe Cities:
The goal aims to create cities that are inclusive, safe, and accessible for all, irrespective of age, gender, disability, or socioeconomic status. This includes providing adequate housing, transportation, and public spaces that cater to the diverse needs of urban populations.

3. Resilience to Disasters:
Building resilience to natural and man-made disasters is a crucial aspect of SDG 11. This involves planning and designing cities to withstand and recover from disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and other emergencies.

4. Environmental Sustainability:
SDG 11 emphasizes the need for cities to adopt sustainable practices that reduce their environmental impact. This includes promoting energy efficiency, waste reduction, sustainable transportation, and green spaces within urban areas.

5. Access to Safe and Affordable Housing:
Ensuring access to safe and affordable housing is a key target. SDG 11 seeks to address issues related to slums and informal settlements, promoting the development of affordable housing for all.

6. Public Transportation and Sustainable Mobility:
Improving public transportation and promoting sustainable mobility options are critical components. This involves investing in efficient and accessible public transportation systems, cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian-friendly urban planning.

7. Cultural Heritage Preservation:
The goal recognizes the importance of preserving cultural heritage in urban areas. This involves safeguarding historical sites, promoting cultural diversity, and ensuring that urban development respects the identity and history of communities.

8. Participation in Urban Planning:
Encouraging community participation in urban planning processes is a key principle. SDG 11 emphasizes the importance of involving local communities in decision-making regarding urban development, ensuring that their needs and perspectives are taken into account.

9. Global Partnership:
   Achieving sustainable cities and communities requires collaboration and partnerships at the local, national, and global levels. SDG 11 calls for increased international cooperation, knowledge-sharing, and support to help cities implement sustainable practices.

10. Monitoring and Indicators:
To track progress, SDG 11 includes a set of indicators that measure various aspects of sustainable urban development. These indicators help countries assess their performance and make informed decisions to achieve the targets of the goal.

Overall, SDG 11 envisions a future where cities are hubs of innovation, inclusivity, and sustainability. By addressing the complex challenges of urbanization, this goal aims to create environments that enhance the quality of life for current and future generations while safeguarding the planet's resources.

SDG 3, or the third Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations, focuses on "Good Health and Well-being." It aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all by 2030. Key targets include reducing maternal mortality, preventing deaths of newborns and children, ending epidemics like AIDS and malaria, addressing non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health, and achieving universal health coverage. 
The goal emphasizes collaboration to create a healthier world. It address various aspects of health, well-being, and healthcare systems to promote a healthier world by the year 2030. Governments, organizations, and individuals are encouraged to work collaboratively to achieve the objectives outlined in SDG 3.

<h2>HOW WASTE SEGREGATION CONTRIBUTES TO SDG 11 & SDG 3: </h2>

- <b>Reduces landfill waste:</b> Proper waste segregation diverts waste from landfills, extending their lifespan and reducing land pollution. This image shows a graph of decreasing landfill waste over time due to increased waste segregation.

- <b>Improves air quality:</b> Burning unsorted waste releases harmful pollutants into the air. By separating organic waste that can be composted, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health.

- <b>Promotes resource conservation:</b> Recycling materials like paper, plastic, and metal reduces the need to extract virgin resources, protecting natural habitats and conserving resources.

- <b>Creates jobs:</b> The recycling industry creates jobs in various sectors, including collection, sorting, processing, and manufacturing.

- <b>Boosts local economies:</b> By diverting waste from landfills and creating jobs in the recycling industry, waste segregation contributes to economic growth and development.

- <b>Empowers communities:</b> When communities are involved in waste segregation programs, they become more invested in environmental sustainability and take ownership of their waste management practices.

- Good health for the people:</b> with clean surroundings comes good health. Hence when the waste segregation process is done well , please have clean air and and a sanitary environment around them.

### PROJECT DETAILS


- Automated sorting of various types of garbage (plastic bags, metal cans, plastic bottles, paper)
- Hands-free operation with a hand motion sensor for automatic opening of the trash bin cover
- Alarm system notifies when any of the trash chambers reach full capacity

### KEY TECH ANALYSIS

<b>ELEMENTS USED:</b>

- Arduino UNO.
- Servo Motor.(SG90)
- Inductive Proximity Sensor.
- Capacitive Proximity Sensor.
- Battery 9~12V.
- Trash bin.
- Trash Bin Cover.

<b>Project Overview:</b>

- Utilizes two types of sensors: capacitive and metal proximity.
- Sensors designed to work in any environment and detect the presence of objects.
- Optional inclusion of an IR distance sensor for measuring trash volume (can be omitted).
- Requires two metal proximity sensors and one capacitive sensor.

<h2>Algorithm:</h2>

- <b>Metal Sensor Check:</b>
When an object passes through a metal sensor, it detects the presence of metal.
If metal is detected, the metal trash bin door opens automatically.

- <b>Metal and Conductive Sensor Check:</b>
The object then passes through both a metal sensor and a conductive sensor.
The conductive trash bin door opens only if the object is conductive but not metal.

- <b>No Sensor Triggered:</b>
If neither metal nor conductive sensors are triggered, the object is identified as neither metal nor conductive.In this case, the trash bin doors remain closed.

The algorithm ensures an efficient sorting process, opening the appropriate bin doors based on the detected characteristics of the passing object.
